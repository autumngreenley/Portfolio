                        This is a Blog Post for Homework Assignment #3.

                        Compiling Java
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This took way longer than it needed to. Evidently, early CS classes at Western are taught in Java. Meaning that by this point, pretty much everyone's good on their Java compiling setup. I've worked in Java before, but the last time was in 2012. Technically I knew the procedure for getting it to work, but it had been long enough that I had to poke around to get it to work again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, after reinstalling the JDK, reestablishing path variables, and hooking up the magic-compilation-words to my code editor, I was able to compile the code. Like an hour in, and I was finally ready to literally look at the very base of what we had to do.

                        Will update when I got more to update with.
