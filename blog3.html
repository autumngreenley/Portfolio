                        Compiling Java
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This took way longer than it needed to. Evidently, early CS classes at Western are taught in Java. Meaning that by this point, pretty much everyone's good on their Java compiling setup. I've worked in Java before, but the last time was in 2012. Technically I knew the procedure for getting it to work, but it had been long enough that I had to poke around to get it to work again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, after reinstalling the JDK, reestablishing path variables, and hooking up the magic-compilation-words to my code editor, I was able to compile the code. Like an hour in, and I was finally ready to literally look at the very base of what we had to do.

                    <!--Refactoring-->
                    <h3>
                        Visual Studio
                    </h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Speaking of things that took a long time... After Visual Studio finished installing, getting it up and running was at least simple. You make a new C# console project, and just go from there. It's convenient for things to like... Just compile. Without having to mess with it for ages. So that was nice!

                    <h3>Refactoring the Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next step was to actually start translating the code over. As per the recommendation, I started with the Node class.
