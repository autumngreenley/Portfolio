                        This is a Blog Post for Homework Assignment #1.

                    <!--Setting up Git-->
                    <h3>
                        Setting up Git
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        So, the first thing I had to do when starting this assignment was to doublecheck my settings with Git. I had previously had a Git account, so I didn't need to make a new one. I evidently still had the command line version installed, so I went ahead and just jumped right into that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was always a little unclear on how to use Git, but listening in in class helped clear stuff up. So I set up the local folder.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>cd Documents/HW/Git
git init
git add *
git commit
git push -u origin master</code></pre>
                    <p>I guess I like doing things the long way, but in the future I should probably just use
                    
                    <code>
                        git commit -m "This is my commit message"
                    </code>
                    
                    instead of manually writing it out in vim.</p>
                    <p>
                        Admittedly, I had a little bit of foolery where I didn't set the folders up right the first time between the local and remote repo, so I ended up having to merge things once or twice. It wasn't too hard to clear up, but I forgot to document exactly what went down. It probably had to do with not pulling the remote repo first so I had some conflicts with the README file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, in the future,<br>
                   </p>
                    <pre><code>git pull
git status
...</code></pre>
                   
                    <!--Base HTML-->
                    <h3>
                        Getting Down the Base Page
                    </h3>
                    
                    <img src="images/thumb.jpg" width="500">
                    
                    <p>
                        I made a basic sketch of the sort of page design I was thinking of before looking at the code much. I thought it would be cool to sort of make it look like pages in a manilla folder, but when I started putting it in the computer and adjusting things, I decided that a page on a folder would be kind of busy and overall have too many frames.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knowing the shape of things, I went ahead and started implementing the basis of it. As most people do (probably), I tend to start with the most notable aspects and work down from there. So I decided to work with the central concept of the base folder bit with the tabs to represent, well, tabs/pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started by making a 'manilla' class in my html. By default, I had every body or whatever that had some sort of background color having a bit of a rounded edge already, since that's modern, but for the tabs I went ahead and made the bottom squared off so it could 'attach' more cleanly. I also messed with the colors a little to give it an illusion of depth.
                    </p>
                    
                   <p>I also added a basic single column layout with Bootstrap. This is the main page:</p>
                                  
                    <pre><code class="pre-scrollable">&lt;div class="manilla">
    &lt;div class="container">
        &lt;div class="row">
            &lt;div class="col-md-12">
                &lt;img class="rounded-circle" src="../images/Screenshot.png" width="350" >
                &lt;h2>About Me&lt;/h2>
                &lt;p>
                    ...
                &lt;/p>
            &lt;/div>
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/div>
&lt;/div></code></pre>
                    
                    <p>and this was the navbar. I ended up having two classes (active and not-active, basically) so that the active tab would be displayed differently than the others.</p>
                    <pre><code>&lt;ul>
    &lt;li class="active">Home&lt;/li>
    &lt;a href="games.html">&lt;li class="navbar">Games&lt;/li>&lt;/a>
    &lt;a href="orgs.html">&lt;li class="navbar">Organizations&lt;/li>&lt;/a>
&lt;/ul></code></pre>
                   <!--CSS-->
                   <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>Most of the heavy lifting was in the css.</p>
                    
                    <pre><code class="pre-scrollable">div.manilla{
    margin-top: 55px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.26);
    background-color: #ffe884;
    padding: 30px 30px 30px;
}
                    
li.navbar {
    float: left;
    display: inline-table;
    list-style-type: none;
    
    margin: 5px;
    padding: 5px;
    padding-left: 20px;
    padding-right: 20px;
    font-size: 17px;
    background-color: #e5d072;
    
    border-top-left-radius: 6px;
    border-top-right-radius:6px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 0px;
    border-bottom-width: 1px;
    border-bottom-color: #e5d072;
}

li.active {
    ...
    background-color: #ffe884;
    ...
    border-bottom-color: #ffe884;
}</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>
                        Otherwise, I didn't have very many other things to mess with. I filled in the other pages similarly, using little bits and pieces that were required (lists, a table, etc). Some of the more notable things were probably...
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>A table</h5>
                    <p>
                        I made a table that was semi-responsive (<code>&lt;table class="table-responsive-sm"></code>) so that when the page is narrow it uses a scrollbar instead of just overflowing over the side.
                    </p>
                    <h5>A two-column layout</h5>
                    <p>
                        Utilizing Bootstrap, I made a two-columned page (using <code>&lt;div class="col-md-6"></code> instead of <code>&lt;div class="col-md-12"></code>, bearing in mind that the total number should add up to 12).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Otherwise, everything was just variations on basic HTML and CSS. I did learn a cool trick though vis a vis css backgrounds. I didn't realize there was a built in gradient function for backgrounds (<code>background-image:linear-gradient(to bottom, #e6ffe9, #f7fff8);</code> makes a nice subtle light-green to lighter-green gradient the background, as seen on this page)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In the end, this is what I wound up with:</p>
