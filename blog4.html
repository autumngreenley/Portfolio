                    <h3>
                        ASP.NET MVC Setup
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Basically, to begin with, you just navigate through Visual Studios various set up steps. For this assignment, we wanted to create a blank ASP.NET MVC (Framework) project. So that's what I did!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After getting the project created, it's just a matter of situating things correctly in the solution view. You have to create a controller, then create a view. The controller navigates around the views. For the controller to navigate to the pages, each view needs a custom function in the controller (as such):
                    </p>
                    
                    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
                        public ActionResult Index()
                        {
                            return View();
                        }
                    </code></pre>

                    <!--VS-->
                    <h3>
                        A Review on Git
                    </h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        To change branches: <code>git checkout branchname</code><br>
                        To change to a new branch: <code>git checkout -b newbranch</code><br>
                        To push to the branch: <code>git push origin branchname</code><br>
                        To set the url of the repo: <code>git remote set-url origin github.com/url</code><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though this is all stuff we've covered before, but I like double checking that I have it all compiled in one place.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>GET Forms</h3>
                    <p>
                        I decided to start with the mile converter. Initially I just copied the format given to us by the example (it's nice not having to design something! I get way too caught up on it). After I had all the base elements down, I just ensured that the form's method was GET.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This gives us query strings in the url. Using those, we can extract the user submitted info and do some calculations. For this part of the problem, we wanted to access them using the Request object (as opposed to paramaters, see the POST section). Getting them is pretty easy, in the controller object you can just check for query strings using their names.
                    </p>
                    
                        <pre><code class="language-csharp">
                            string givenunit = Request.QueryString["unit"];
                            double givenmiles = Convert.ToDouble(Request.QueryString["miles"]);
                        </code></pre>
                    
                    <p>
                        I needed to add a bit at the bottom of the page if the user had made some kind of input and submitted it. To do that, you just need to use a bit of Razer. In this case I just needed to check if my calculation variable was empty, and if it wasn't, to append the sentence that showed the user the result. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
                        @if (ViewBag.message != null)
                        {...}
                    </code></pre>
                    
                    <h3>POST Forms</h3>
                    <p>To be continued...</p>
